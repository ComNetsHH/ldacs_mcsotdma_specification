  abstract = {Ubiquitous object networking has sparked the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT), which defines a new era in the world of networking. Realization of this concept needs to be addressed by standardization efforts that will shape the infrastructure of the networks. This has been achieved through the IEEE 802.15.4e, 6LoWPAN, and IPv6 standards. In addition, the IEEE 802.15.4e standard, which can be considered as the backbone of the IoT structure, has presented timeslotted channel hopping (TSCH). Although these standards provide a coherent and diffused system, several implications challenge these standards to achieve optimal performance and reliability. Node mobility can be considered as the delimited factor for realizing a fully connected network, especially with the inclusion of TSCH mode that will complicate the association process of the mobile nodes, as a result of the frequency hopping mechanism. In this paper, we investigate the impact of mobility over the TSCH sensor network, and a Markov chain model is presented to determine the parameters that affect mobile node association process. Second, we provide a proposed mobility-aware Mobile Timeslotted Channel Hopping (MTSCH) protocol that will facilitate the mobile nodes association and minimize the latency incurred by leaving the nodes dissociated from the network. TSCH and the proposed MTSCH techniques have been implemented and evaluated through Contiki OS. The proposed MTSCH manages to reduce the radio duty cycle of the mobile nodes by an average of 30\% while increasing the connectivity of the nodes by 25\%. Moreover, cluster heads managed to save energy by a ratio of 14\%.},

In the last decade, a significant number of synthetic mobility models have been proposed. However, only a few of these models have been validated by realistic movement traces. In the last few years, several of such traces have been collected, analyzed, and made available to the community. This paper provides a comprehensive and up-to-date survey of (1) available movement traces, (2) modeling/analyses of these traces, and (3) synthetic mobility models. The focus of the paper is on mobility traces/models that include position information.

By combining time slotted access with multi-channel and channel hopping capabilities, it is particularly suitable for critical applications that require high reliability and deterministic latency. In this paper we focus on the formation process of TSCH networks. This relies on periodic advertisement of Enhanced Beacons (EBs), however, the standard does not specify any advertising strategy. By taking a theoretical approach, we first derive a general model of the network formation process and provide an analytical formulation of the average joining time (i.e., the time taken by a node to join the network). Then, we derive an optimal strategy for scheduling EB transmissions that minimizes the average joining time. Finally, we propose a new Model-based Beacon Scheduling (MBS) algorithm that approximates the optimal strategy in real networks. We evaluate the performance of MBS by simulation. Our results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms previous solutions present in the literature.},

The performances of the two FEC schemes Reed-Solomon Codes and Random Linear Network Coding are compared. Uncorrelated and correlated packet errors are considered, the latter with a Gilbert-Elliot channel model. Experiments are conducted in a testbed consisting of a single PC with virtual network interfaces to determine the influence of various parameter settings on performance. Results are compared against a scenario with one link offering the same capacity as the two links together. It is concluded that using two heterogeneous links is beneficial for the goodput and losses for generation sizes larger than 20 for three correlated lost packets on average.},

  abstract = {Cognitive Radios (CRs) tackle the spectrum scarcity problem by allowing unlicensed access on already-licensed spectrum. Where primary user (PU) radio systems hold a privileged medium access, secondary users (SUs) try to utilize and use spare time-frequency resources to establish communication. At their core, CRs need to sense, detect and predict the medium access pattern of PUs in order to facilitate communication. A promising approach for inferring these predictions is the use of Machine Learning techniques and in particular Artifical Neural Networks (ANNs). ANNs try to learn a mapping from a set of inputs to a specific desired output and can therefore be directly applied to the problem of PU activity prediction. Especially Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) show adequate performance for noisy measurement data and prolonged training periods. In this work, the applicability of ANN-based channel state prediction is examined via a case study on the upcoming aeronautical communication technology L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS). LDACS is envisioned to reuse spectral resources currently primarily allocated to other aeronautical systems such as the Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) system. Primary and secondary users are modeled with respect to preliminary LDACS specifications and the performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated via simulation. We show that RNNs can function as prediction agents for SU LDACS medium access and that stringent reliability and interference requirements can be met. A supervised learning problem, together with an incremental learning strategy is proposed to address time-varying PU channel access patterns. Finally, a brief discussion on the use of predictions in a distributed scheduling approach is given.},

We first propose a mathematical programming approach consisting of two steps: the minimization of the weighted hop count (mWHC) subject to scheduling constraints, followed by average delay minimization for the previously computed routes. Since the computational complexity of this approach is prohibitive for larger networks, we also formulate a genetic algorithm (GA) that can be applied to larger networks and mobile networks. We analyze the performance of both approaches by means of simulations and compare the solution that they provide to a simple hop-count-based routing and gateway selection solution. It is shown that the performance of the GA is comparable with the mathematical programming approach in terms of delay and packet delivery ratio (PDR) at lower complexity and is significantly better than the hop-count-based solution.},

To overcome data rate, delay and cost limitations of SC and coverage limitations of DA2GC, one can extend DA2GC with air-to-air communication (A2AC) by enabling multi-hop communication. To investigate the A2AC performance, we construct a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem of DA2GC and A2AC, jointly considering interference in topology formation and flow assignment. Our objective is to maximize the number of aircraft that can be connected with a given specific minimum data rate threshold. The evaluation is performed for low aircraft density scenarios over the North Atlantic. We show that in the investigated scenarios, over 90 \% of aircraft can have at least 50 Mbps, some being up to 1600 kilometers away from the closest base station (BS). Furthermore, we identify antenna capabilities as an important factor for A2AC performance.},

  abstract = {Two main types of distance measuring equipment (DME)—that is,DME/N and DME/P—have been standardized by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This chapter views both DME/N and the new DME/P from a broad systems engineering perspective. Like many other navigation aids, DME is characterized in terms of a signal format, accuracy, coverage, radio frequency assignment, the measurement technique used to extract the DME navigation parameter, and the output guidance information rate. A DME must also satisfy certain levels of signal integrity and availability. The chapter provides the background and historical perspective necessary to view DME in the broader context of air navigation and its specific role in the National Airspace System (NAS). The navigation applications discussed in this chapter are restricted to the air traffic control system as it is defined by the ICAO and as it is implemented in the United States. Therefore, only the domestic enroute, terminal, and approach/landing phases of flight have been addressed. Enroute and approach/landing scenarios have been defined using only the conventional takeoff and land (CTOL) aircraft type. However, DME is not restricted to these applications or to CTOL aircraft. Both helicopter and remote area operations, for example, come under the broad envelope of DME applications.},

  abstract = {Spectrum scarcity requires novel approaches for sharing frequency resources between different radio systems.  	Where coordination is not possible, intelligent approaches are needed, allowing a novel "secondary" system to access unused resources of a legacy (primary) system without requiring modifications of this primary system.  	Machine Learning is a promising approach to recognize patterns of the primary system and adapt the channel access accordingly.  	In this contribution we investigate the capability of Feed-Forward Deep Learning and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to detect communication patterns of the primary user.  	Therefore we take the example of a new aeronautical system (LDACS) coexisting with three different systems.  	Firstly the coexistence with the Distance Measurement Equipment (DME) providing a deterministic interference to the secondary user and secondly with two synthetic channel access patterns, realized by a 2-state Markov model, modeling a bursty channel access behavior, as well as through a sequential channel access model. 	It can be shown that the Markov property of a Gilbert-Elliot channel model limits the predictability; nonetheless, we show that the model characteristics can be fully learned, which could leverage the design of interference avoidance systems that make use of this knowledge. 	The determinism of DME allows an error-free prediction, and it is shown that the reliability of sequential access model prediction depends on the model's parameter. 	The limits of Feed-Forward Deep Neural Networks are highlighted, and why LSTM RNNs are state-of-the-art models in this problem domain. 	We show that these models are capable of online learning, as well as of learning correlations over long periods of time.},

  abstract = {Upcoming communication systems increasingly often tackle the spectrum scarcity problem through the coexistence with legacy systems in the same frequency band. Cognitive Radio presents popular methods for Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) that enable coexistence. Historically, DSA meant a separation solely in the frequency domain, while in recent years it has been extended through the dimension of time, by employing Machine Learning to learn semi-deterministic and cyclic medium access patterns of the legacy system that are observed through channel sensing. When this pattern is learnable, then a new system can utilize a neural network and predict future medium accesses, thus steering its own medium access. We investigate this novel and more fine-grained version of DSA, propose a predictor and show its capability of reliably predicting future medium accesses of a legacy system in an aeronautical coexistence scenario. We extend the predictor to the case of partial observability, where only a narrowband receiver is available, s.t. observations are limited to a single sensed channel per time slot. In particular, we propose a custom loss function that is tailored to partially observable environments. In the spirit of Open Science, all implementation files will be made available upon publication.},

  abstract = {Alternative position, navigation, and timing (APNT) systems are needed by aviation to maintain operations for prolonged periods during an absence of Global Positioning System (GPS) service. This is especially important in the future as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) utilizes GPS to efficiently handle the anticipated twofold increase in air traffic over the next 15 years. Thus, an APNT system must be able to support the full capacity of future airspace. One candidate APNT system is distance measuring equipment (DME). Since DME has capacity limits, it is important to understand these limits and how they may be increased. This paper models DME capacity and uses the model to examine potential means of improving capacity. Results indicate that increasing DME station reply rate reduces availability for avionics at the current minimum operational performance standards (MOPS). However, with reasonable MOPS changes, DME could support anticipated air traffic levels. Copyright \# 2012 Institute of Navigation.},

In this paper we propose and compare clustering schemes that are applicable for integrating D2D communications into cellular networks such that communication services can be maintained when the cellular infrastructure becomes partially dysfunctional. Our results show that there is a trade-off between coverage, energy efficiency and cluster formation delay and this trade-off can be handled by our proposed threshold-based clustering scheme.},

In particular, the Iridium satellite constellation has demonstrated its usefulness and flexibility. It has had significant impact on how operations are conducted. Iridium provides users both voice and data services. There are two approaches to sending data over the Iridium network a circuit-switched data service and message-switched data service. Use of the circuit-switched data service requires the overhead of a setup in the same manner as a voice call. There are two message-switched data services Short Burst Data SBD and Short Message Service SMS. Our testing involves the SBD message-switched data service, which is optimized for high capacity and efficiency when sending small amounts of data through the Iridium network. While there are many users for these services, little information can be found about their actual performance in fielded systems. The best sources of information are specifications or modeling of the performance of these services. We perceived that understanding the underlying network performance was needed, and we established experiments to capture that performance. We present results from both circuit-switched data service and message-switched SBD data service. We also address insights into the use of these services.},

Aircraft populate the international airspace very heterogeneously. Some regions experience highly dense air traffic, with aircraft headings being largely uncorrelated. Other regions remain only very sparsely populated, with aircraft typically flying parallel to each other. Moreover, the number of airborne aircraft in a given region changes significantly throughout the day. In this paper, we focus on the densely populated European airspace, and investigate the topological behavior of multihop ad hoc wireless networks formed by air-air links of varying communications range. We derive analytical expressions for various topological aspects, such as the lifetime of inter-aircraft links, and the projected hop length using greedy forwarding. These results are in good agreement with the behavior observed in our simulations of the European air traffic scenario.

There has been an intense debate in the community on which technology achieves best performance. However, existing studies do not take into account the variability present in the generation and size of V2X messages. This variability can significantly impact the operation and performance of the Medium Access Control (MAC). This study progresses the state of the art by conducting an in-depth evaluation of both technologies under different message traffic patterns. In particular, we consider aperiodic and periodic messages of constant or variable size based on the standardized ETSI Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs). This study considers different scenarios and possible configurations of IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V2X. We demonstrate that IEEE 802.11p can better cope with variations in the size and time interval between messages. We also demonstrate (and characterize) that the LTE-V2X sensing-based semi-persistent scheduling faces certain inefficiencies when transmitting aperiodic messages of variable size.

  abstract = {In mobile ad hoc networks, network nodes cooperate by packet forwarding from the source to the destination. As the networks become denser, more control packets are forwarded, thus consuming more bandwidth and may cause packet loss. Recently, game theory has been applied to address several problems in mobile ad hoc networks like energy efficiency. In this paper, we apply game theory to reduce the control packets in dense networks. We choose a proactive routing protocol, Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol. We consider two strategies in this method: willingness\_always and willingness\_never to reduce the multipoint relay (MPR) ratio in dense networks. Thus, nodes with less influence on other nodes are excluded from nomination as MPRs. Simulations were used to confirm the efficiency of using our improved method. The results show that the MPR ratio was significantly reduced, and packet delivery ratio was increased compared to the conventional protocol.},

Addressing these challenges requires the design of new protocols and mechanisms specific to this environment.

This method also reduces the Internet traffic load on satellite nodes and also propagation delay for real-time traffic transmissions, by effectively bypassing the satellite link for nonreal time data. A dynamic routing algorithm is also proposed for efficient routing in this kind of system.

In this article, new developments in aeronautical communications for air traffic management are presented, with special focus on the air/ground communications technology L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS). The most promising LDACS technology candidate, LDACS1, is described in detail, and possible extensions toward navigation and surveillance are discussed. With these extensions, LDACS1 is well placed to become the first integrated communications, navigation, and surveillance technology for civil aviation.

Looking into details, satellite communications currently seems to be the only reliable way to connect and send data on long-distance flights. However, geostationary satellite systems suffer from high propagation delays making Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes beneficial compared to error handling by retransmissions. In this paper, Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) is proposed as a packet level FEC technique for high delay satellite communication. Using emulation, it is shown that correlated losses typical for a satellite channel result in a high variation in the number of redundant symbols required to decode a generation. This can be improved by using interleaving, which comes by the cost of an increased delay. A novel approach is introduced that combines On-the-fly Coding and interleaving. This can significantly reduce the average delay introduced by interleaving and allows to efficiently overcome correlated losses in combination with Network Coding for time-critical applications.},

  abstract = {In-flight Internet connectivity is a necessity for aircraft passengers as well as aircraft systems. It is challenging to satisfy required quality of service (QoS) levels for flows within aircraft due to the large number of users and the highly varying air to ground (A2G) link capacities composed of satellite and direct air to ground communication (DA2GC). To represent service quality variations, we propose models for the generated traffic flows from aircraft and variations in A2G links. We present three different forwarding schemes based on priority, delay requirements and history of the dropped flows metrics. Forwarding schemes schedule the flows in real time by choosing either satellite or direct air to ground link depending on the delay and capacity requirements of flows to maximize the number of accepted flows with required QoS guarantees in terms of dropped packets and delay. Also, the effect of local caching is studied to fully satisfy the QoS requirement of flows in simulated flights. We implement the forwarding procedures and caching in ns-3 and test their performance in a current connectivity scenario of 100 Mbps capacity for both the satellite spot and ground base station in a one-hour flight. Our study shows that although the forwarding procedure based on a combination of priority and delay requirement has relatively better performance than the other schemes, which are based on priority only and weighted average of all metrics, in dropped packet percentage and delay, the current connectivity setup is not able to satisfy all QoS requirements. Furthermore, at least 0.9 cache hit rate is required to satisfy all flows for at least 50\% of simulated flights.},

Using a distributed coordination function (DCF), the CSMA/CA protocol reduces collisions and improves the overall throughput. To mitigate fairness issues arising with CSMA/CA, we develop a modified version that we term CSMA with copying collision avoidance (CSMA/CCA). A station in CSMA/CCA contends for the shared wireless medium by employing a binary exponential backoff similar to CSMA/CA. Different from CSMA/CA, CSMA/CCA copies the contention window (CW) size piggybacked in the MAC header of an overheard data frame within its basic service set (BSS) and updates its backoff counter according to the new CW size. Simulations carried out in several WLAN configurations illustrate that CSMA/CCA improves fairness relative to CSMA/CA and offers considerable advantages for deployment in the 802.11-standard-based WLANs.},

We introduce the first practical generation-less sliding window RLNC scheme, which is built on existing generation based coders. Through discrete simulation and a proof of concept implementation, we show that, the in-order delay can be improved compared to generation based schemes while retaining the reliability, computational complexity and overhead.},

In this paper, we present an analytical framework to investigate co-channel spatial reuse in dense wireless ad-hoc networks based on RF propagation models for some common network topologies. We derive the minimum separation between simultaneous co-channel transmitters while maintaining desirable signal-noise-interference-ratio at receivers. Spatial reuse is characterized by the ratio between co-channel transmitter (T-T) and transmit-receiver (T-R) distances. Our results show that increasing transmission power improves spatial reuse in ambient noise dominated environments. However, in co-channel interference limited scenarios, increasing transmission power has little effect on spatial reuse. On the other hand, more simultaneous transmissions can be physically possible by decreasing the average T-R separation, independent of transmission power. Our results confirm that the popular practice of using static transmission/interference ranges leads to an oversimplified model that is unable to accurately characterize the spatial reuse (and consequently aggregate network capacity) in ad-hoc networks.},

  abstract = {The engineering vision of relying on the “smart sky” for supporting air traffic and the “internet-above-the-clouds” for in-flight entertainment has become imperative for the future aircraft industry. Aeronautical ad hoc networking (AANET) constitutes a compelling concept for providing broadband communications above clouds by extending the coverage of air-to-ground (A2G) networks to oceanic and remote airspace via autonomous and self-configured wireless networking among commercial passenger airplanes. The AANET concept may be viewed as a new member of the family of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) in action above the clouds. However, AANETs have more dynamic topologies, larger and more variable geographical network size, stricter security requirements, and more hostile transmission conditions. These specific characteristics lead to more grave challenges in aircraft mobility modeling, aeronautical channel modeling, and interference mitigation as well as in network scheduling and routing. This paper provides an overview of AANET solutions by characterizing the associated scenarios, requirements, and challenges. Explicitly, the research addressing the key techniques of AANETs, such as their mobility models, network scheduling and routing, security, and interference, is reviewed. Furthermore, we also identify the remaining challenges associated with developing AANETs and present their prospective solutions as well as open issues. The design framework of AANETs and the key technical issues are investigated along with some recent research results. Furthermore, a range of performance metrics optimized in designing AANETs and a number of representative multiobjective optimization algorithms are outlined.},
