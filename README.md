The PDF `mcsotdma_specification.pdf` of this repository depicts the specification of the proposed Multi Channel Self-Organized TDMA (MCSOTDMA) Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol that is being proposed for the L-Band Digital 
Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS) Air-Air (A/A) mode.

It is a result of the research project "Inter Aircraft Network (IntAirNet)".
This project was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action under its FÃ¶rderkennzeichen (identifier) 20V1708F.

The document is intended to allow an implementation of the protocol and to guide a possible standardization.
